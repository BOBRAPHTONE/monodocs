<!-- --- title: Tutorial: Drawing UI elements -->

**In this tutorial we will go through the UI elements and how Mono's display system will draw them. We will create a simple application that demonstrates how to use the prefabricated UI elements, and how to respond to their touch events.**

<!-- Why use it -->
Mono's display system allows you to easily composite graphical user interfaces. It automatically takes care of drawing in-between display refreshes, and utilizes the touch input system to respond to touch events.

<!-- intro: problem that is solved -->
When you use the existing interface elements for buttons, text and other controls, you can quickly build standardized user interfaces for your application. Also, you leverage on the capabilities of the UI system components, to handle the pixels drawing. You are still able to customize the components to colors and sizes to your choosing.
